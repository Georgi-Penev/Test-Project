# New-Project
This is a test project I wanted to do.
The idea is a SPA site with a "game" that is a rougelike. You choose a race and a job and start your adventure.
Each race and job have diffrent stats: Health, Strenght, Intelligence, Dexterity. You can choose say a human as a race which has base stats and a job say warrior which adds stats but also has items.
When starting a run you will fight a monsters with increasing difficulty but also get items that boost your stats, weapons, armors and/or jewellery with special powers.
This is the plan at least, I will be working on this mainly to practise my skills.

Update: Implemented tooltips for the select options, which are now dynamyc and can be changed in the files for the jobs and races.
To do: Sidebar for the current stats of the hero
